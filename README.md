# Delta-3D-printer
This printer is actually a journey of five years, although many details have been lost due to lost/damaged phones and PC.

the images in the folder show the most recent developments.
Built around the Marlin platform. The printer is able to print at around 150mm/s.
Currently, it has no heated bed and can print only PLA.Having a build volume of 200mmx200mmx250mm is sufficient for most of my work. I still hope to make this open source when finally stable. You can check the images folder for exciting Demos!
